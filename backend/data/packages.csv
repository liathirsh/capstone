1,Requests,"One of the most popular general Python libraries is Requests, which aims to make HTTP requests simpler and more human-friendly. Licensed under the Apache2 license and written in Python, Requests is the de facto standard used by developers for making HTTP requests in Python.

In addition to using the Requests library for sending HTTP requests to a server, it also allows adding form data, content, header, multi-part files, etc. with them. With the library, developers need not add a query to the URL or form-encode the POST data manually.

The Requests library abstracts the numerous complexities of making HTTP requests in a simple API so that developers can focus more on interacting with services. The library offers official support for Python 2.7, 3.4, and above and works great on PyPy too.",0,1
2,Pillow,"Python Imaging Library or PIL is a free Python library that adds an image processing ability to the Python interpreter. In simple terms, PIL allows manipulating, opening, and saving various image file formats in Python. Created by Alex Clark and other contributors, Pillow is a fork of the PIL library.",0,1
3,Scrappy,"Python Imaging Library or PIL is a free Python library that adds an image processing ability to the Python interpreter. In simple terms, PIL allows manipulating, opening, and saving various image file formats in Python. Created by Alex Clark and other contributors, Pillow is a fork of the PIL library.",0,1
4,Asyncio,"Numerous Python developers around the world make use of the asyncio library for writing concurrent code using the async/await syntax. In most cases, the asyncio library is ideal for IO-bound and high-level structured network code.",0,2
5,Tkinter,"When used with Tkinter, Python offers an easy and fast way of creating GUI applications. Tkinter is the standard GUI library for the Python programming language. It offers a powerful object-oriented interface for the Tk GUI toolkit.",0,2
6,Six,"Although simplistic, Six is a powerful Python library that is meant to smooth out the differences between various Python 2 and Python 3 versions. Six is intended for supporting codebases that can operate on both Python 2 and Python 3 without the need for modifications.",0,2
7,aiohttp,"Another simple yet widely used Python library is the aiohttp. It is basically meant to be an asynchronous HTTP client or server in Python. Beyond this and offering out-of-the-box support for Client WebSockets and Server WebSockets, there’s nothing more to this Python library.",0,3
8,pygame,"Pygame is a free and open-source Python library that is meant for accomplishing multimedia application development in Python, especially two-dimensional gaming projects. Hence, it is widely used by both casual and professional Python game developers.",0,3
9,Kivy,"For building mobile apps and multi-touch application software with a NUI (Natural User Interface), Python developers rely on the Kivy library. The free and open-source Python library is distributed under the MIT license and runs on Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, and Windows.",0,3
10,Bokeh,"An interactive visualization library for the Python programming language, Bokeh allows visualizing data in a beautiful and meaningful way inside contemporary web browsers. The data visualization library eases the creation of dashboards, data applications, and interactive plots.",0,4
11,NumPy,"NumPy is one of the best open source Python modules for scientific and numerical computing and data analyses. In fact, it even provides the foundation for a few other Python libraries, such as SciPy and Sci-Kit Learn. NumPy is most often used for mathematical operations with matrices and arrays. Thanks to its efficient yet quick computations, NumPy is the Python library of choice for many scientists performing data analyses.",0,4
12,SciPy,"Like NumPy, SciPy is free and open source, making it accessible for everyone. SciPy is based on NumPy and can also be used for technical and scientific computing with large data sets. It plays a critical role in engineering and scientific analysis, which is why it’s also considered an important library in Python. Some even call it a foundational library for the programming language.",0,4
